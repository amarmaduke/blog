## Introduction to Computational Complexity Theory
definitions, motivations, some proofs?

## The Complexity Hierarchy
expand on what's the fastest, what's the slowest

## Determining Time and Space Complexity
some examples to figure out the complexity of stuff

## Heuristics Using Problem Bounds
here is how you know if something is fast enough sometimes! {% cite ruby %}
