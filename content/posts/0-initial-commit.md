I haven't written anything on my blog since 2017.
That is a very long time.
Personally, I think that is because I was under the illusion that the content of my blog has to be good, because people could read it.
The reality, is that even if some random person _does_ read it the likelihood I interact with this person about a blog post that they _didn't_ like is basically zero.

Anyway here is some $\KaTeX$ because I want to test it out with this new blog setup.

$$\int_0^x e^x dx$$

I'm using Zola and the theme Serene, which you can see there at the bottom right.
It is pretty spiffy and I like the theme overall, zola is also really nice a step up from Jekyll in my opinion.
Anyway, if you are reading this, including you future Andrew, don't take the blog too seriously, it's just a romping good time.
