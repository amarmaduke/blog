I'm a Computer Science PhD student working in the [Computational Logic Center](http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/site/).
My advisor is [Dr. Aaron Stump](https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~astump/).
I work with Aaron and others on [Cedille](https://github.com/cedille).
My current research revolves around how Cedille's unique feature set (dependent intersections, equality, erased function spaces) can be used to capture and construct many of the ideas in other languages.
