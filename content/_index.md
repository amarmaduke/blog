I'm a postdoc working in the [Computational Logic Center](http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/site/) under [Dr. J. Garrett Morris](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~jgmorrs/).
My primary focus is PL theory and mechanization using tools like Agda and Lean4.
I also work on the formal theory and implementation of [Cedille2](https://github.com/cedille/cedille2).
